## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/DLMBM/DLMBM.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

*italic*
**bold**
```
int x = 5;

```
'int x=5'

* topic artificial
* topic healthcare
  *  big data
  *  two big data
    * third big data

1. topic artificial
1. topic healthcare
  1. big data
  1. two big data

this is inline code 'int x=5' here

this is inline code ```
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

I think '<int c=5>' element

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/DLMBM/DLMBM.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
